            Keeva, a talented artist and trained architect, is starting to make public the talent she has kept to herself for decades, making an incursion at the intersection of 
            traditional art and digital innovation. She has collaborated in the past with the Curator Collective in creating digital renditions of physical art pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Keeva's personal artwork remains under wraps, she has recently started showing physical pieces 
            that capture the spirit of modern technology and culture, in work commissioned by the Curator Collective. Her upcoming collection, <strong>"Bitcoin is the 
            Tip of the Iceberg"</strong>, is a profound exploration of the cultural waves created by Bitcoin and various 
            memecoins within the Stacks Blockchain ecosystem. This collection juxtaposes the monumental impact of Bitcoin 
            with the bubbling creativity and humor of memecoins, symbolizing how these cultural elements shape the community.

            The piece featured in this collection, <strong>"Tip of the Iceberg"</strong>, vividly illustrates Keeva's 
            artistic depth. It portrays Bitcoin as the towering peak of an iceberg, with vibrant memecoins represented 
            in playful, luminous bubbles below the surface. Also, Stacks blockchain and a Runestone symbols are seen in the submerged part of the iceberg. The artwork speaks to the multilayered influence of cryptocurrency 
            in today's world, highlighting the unseen forces that drive innovation and cultural movements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keevaâ€™s contribution to the Curator Collective shows her  spirit of experimentation and collaboration, bridging 
            the physical and digital realms, and we are glad to have her join the list of artists we are highlighting in our collections.
